Hi,

I did Djikstra shortest path algorithm with priority queue for
unvisited notes, and stored the shortest path info
for all machines. Afterwards, I iterates over the machines and put
the ones which have the requested element in a priority queue.
The priority queue prioritize according to the requested preference.
If search preference was cost, the element with lowest cost will
be first in queue.
Since the method for search preference = B also satisfies the
request for search preference = C with no lower
efficiency, I used method for search preference= B
for C as well.

Dijkstra method with priority queue has run time O(E + Vlog(V))
E = edges and V = nodes.

The rest are programs to print out the stored info, which
are not very relevant.
